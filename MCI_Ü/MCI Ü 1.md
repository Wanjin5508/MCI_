# User-Centred-Design-Process
--> gebrauchstaugliche Benutzungsschnittstellen

## User Centred Design - Principles
- Design is based on an **explicit understanding** of users, tasks and environments
- **Process** is iterative
- **Users are involved** throughout design and development
- Design addresses the whole **user experience**
- Design is driven and refined by **user-centred-evaluation**. -> *evaluation is not test! *
- Design team includes **multidisciplinary skills** and perspectives

## What is UCD? - Design based on the User
- **注意:** 不能强制改变用户行为。

## Common UI Observations

## What problem is addressed by UCD? - Questions to Answer via UCD
- **Who** are the users of the product?
- the **tasks** and **goals** of users?
- What are the **users' experience** levels with the product, and **similar products**
- What **functions** do the users need from the product
- What **information** might the users need, and in what form do they need it?
- How do users think the product should **work**?
- What are the **extreme environments** in which product can be accessed in?
- Does the **interface** utilises **different input modes**, such as touch, speech, gestures or orientation?

## What problem is addressed by UCD? - Goal: Usability

## There is not just graphics:
- Most people think of graphical user interfaces when talking about user interaction
- --> UCD applies to each and every system process that interacts with the user.

## UCD vs. Participatory Design - Approaches

### PD Definition
- During an innovation process, participants (putative, potential or future) are invited to cooperate with 
	- designers
	- researchers
	- developers
- Potentially, they participate during several stages of an innovation process:
	- during the initial exploration and problem definition both to help define the problem and to focus ideas for solution
	- during development, they help evaluate proposed solutions.

### Phases of UCD
![[Pasted image 20231102091549.png]]
#### 1. Context - specify context of use
> Identify who the **primary users** of the product are, **why** they will use the product, what are their **requirement** and under what **environment** they will use it.

#### 2. User - specify requirements
> to specify the granular requirements of the product
> This is an important phase which can further **facilitate the designers** to create **storyboards**, and set important **goals** to make the product successful

#### 3. Design - create design solutions and development
> based on product **goals** and **requirements**, start an iterative process of product design and development.

#### 4. Evaluation - evaluate product
> Product designers do usability testing to get users' feedback for the product at every stage of UCD.
